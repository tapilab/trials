If it's the first time to launch the app, please run the index.py to index the documents
Anytime the trials files are changed, documents need to be indexed again

Here is the Flask application to search over the trials.
Run ./run.py to launch the server, then open up http://localhost:5000

If you want to change the file path for documents or index, go to file_path.txt
