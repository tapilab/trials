# Clinical Trials

In this project, our goal is to rank clinical trials based on provided inclusion/exclusion criteria.

1. Download Cancer-related trials from https://clinicaltrials.gov/
2. Index all the trails with Whoosh 
3. Run the search app which allows user to input patient information with Flask framwork 
4. Create a patient object then pass a searching query for search
5. Return the match results and highlight the matching biomarker terms.
