   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adults and children with known or suspected thyroid neoplasm will be considered for
        participation.  Enrollment will be capped accordingly:

          1. Patients with thyroid nodules requiring evaluation and possible biopsy (no more than
             30 per year);

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        On referral, persons of any age will be considered for the inclusion in the study because
        of either:

        A family or personal history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number; OR,

        known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital
        factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies or Mendelian traits
        associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications, occupation, radiation, diet,
        infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features (very young age of onset,
        multiple tumors, etc.).

        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,
        and review of pathology slides and medical records.  For familial neoplasms, two or more
        living affected cases among family members are required. The types of familial tumors that
        we are currently actively accruing include:

        Familial Cancers:  bladder, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
        (NBCC)

        Familial Benign Neoplasms:  meningiomas, neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic
        neurofibromatosis)

        The types of familial tumors under active accrual and study are predominantly
        investigator-and hypothesis-driven.  This approach permits GEB investigators to remain
        alert to the opportunities afforded by clusters of rare tumors in families and
        individuals, and to be more responsive to the dynamic research priorities in cancer
        genetics.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Referred individuals and families for whom reported diagnoses cannot be verified.

        Inability to provide informed consent.

        Eligible for familial melanoma, lymphoproliferative, breast-ovarian cancer, or testicular
        cancer protocols.

        Young adults with cancer (YACers) who are acting as counselors at Camp Fantastic.

          -  All children/young adults will be selected for camp after careful screening by a
             multidisciplinary committee consisting of medical and program directors. While the
             state of the child   s health will certainly be considered there will be no
             exclusions for:

          -  Patients who are receiving intramuscular, intrathecal, oral or intravenous
             medications or blood products.

          -  Patients who become febrile and neutropenic at the onset or during the week of camp
             will stay at camp on antibiotic therapy providing their condition remains stable.

          -  At the discretion of the multidisciplinary committee consisting of medical and
             program directors, special exceptions may be made for patients with extenuating
             circumstances.

          -  All children will be officially enrolled and will have an NIH Clinical Center Patient
             Care Number.  The enrollment of a child, signing of protocol consent, and completion
             of admission paperwork is done in person but under extenuating circumstances it may
             be done over the phone after the paperwork has been mailed to the parent/guardian.

        Subjects with clinical manifestations of a congenital anomaly or craniofacial syndrome, or
        a single congenital anomaly that is also seen as part of a congenital anomaly syndrome
        will be considered eligible for participation in this protocol.

        Blood will also be requested on unaffected relatives that could be informative for linkage
        studies or for determining co-segregation of mutations within families.  Subjects of
        either gender and all ethnic and racial groups will be accepted.

        Prenatal specimens (amniocentesis or CVS) will be accepted if they are previously acquired
        for clinically indicated reasons.  Cord blood or placenta specimens may be accepted if
        they (or a part of them) are not needed for clinical purposes.

        Specimens from patients collected at outside institutions may be accepted into the study
        if they were collected under an IRB-approved protocol at an MPA or FWA institution.

        Coded specimens (specimens linked to identifiers but without personal identifiers attached
        to the sample) may be acquired from other NIH investigators, analyzed, and returned as
        research results to that investigator.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with    typical    GCPS or PHS who have demonstrated GLI3 mutations may be
        excluded from this study.  Patients with phenotypes and disorders with a high risk/benefit
        ratio such as late-onset, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and cancer-predisposition
        disorders will be excluded from participation. Similarly, patients who are medically
        fragile or unable to tolerate travel to the NIH CC will not routinely be eligible for
        participation. Probands who are adults and decisionally-impaired are ineligible if they do
        not have a legal guardian who has authority to sign a consent form on their behalf.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be those already diagnosed with TSC (definite, probable, or possible) based
        on clinical criteria and/or genetic testing, and ranging in age from 18 to 90 years old.

        The clinical features of TSC considered of major significance are:  facial angiofibromas
        or forehead plaque, nontraumatic periungual fibromas, three or more hypomelanotic macules,
        shagreen patch, multiple retinal nodular hamartomas, cortical tuber, subependymal nodule,
        subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, cardiac rhabdomyoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and
        renal angiomyolipoma.

        The minor features of TSC are: multiple randomly distributed pits in dental enamel,
        hamartomatous rectal polyps, bone cysts, cerebral white matter radial migration lines,
        gingival fibromas, nonrenal hamartoma, retinal achromic patch,    confetti    skin
        lesions,  and multiple renal cysts (5).  Definite TSC is diagnosed by the presence of two
        major features or one major feature plus two minor features.  Probable TSC is diagnosed by
        the presence of one major feature and one minor feature.  Possible TSC is diagnosed by the
        presence of either one major feature or two or more minor features.  Patients will not be
        preselected for skin lesions, but about 80% of patients with TSC are expected to have skin
        lesions.

          -  Any additional medical condition, serious illness, or other extenuating circumstance
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere with study
             compliance.

        Additionally DCE-MRI is not done in patients with acute or chronic renal insufficiency
        since gadolinium chelate injection is contraindicated in those patients. In patients where
        DCE-MRI is considered, a creatinine clearance measurement is performed as a clinically
        indicated test by the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the NIH Clinical Center.
        Patients with impaired kidney function will not undergo DCE-MRI. DCE-MRI is also not done
        in patients with severe claustrophobia or the presence of iron or metal in the MRI scan
        site, in patients with pacemakers or defibrillators, and in patients with an allergy to
        gadolinium.

             leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma [CLL/SLL] or Hodgkin lymphoma) with primary
             refractory or relapsed disease after standard chemotherapy at high risk of relapse
             with conventional autografting; patients with a diagnosis of CLL (or small
             lymphocytic lymphoma) or diagnosis of CLL that progresses to prolymphocytic leukemia
             (PLL), or T-cell CLL or PLL

          -  Must have an HLA genotypically or phenotypically identical related donor or, at a
             minimum, a high likelihood of identifying an HLA-matched unrelated donor; the
             determination of availability of a suitable unrelated donor may be based on a
             World-Book search

          -  Cross-over to other tandem autologous-allogeneic research protocol (#2241) will be
             allowed if the patient loses the suitable HLA-matched related or unrelated donor but
             has an available HLA-haploidentical donor before receiving the allogeneic
             transplantation and if the patient meets the eligibility criteria of the subsequent
             study

          -  Cross-over from other tandem autologous-allogeneic research protocol (#2241) will be
             allowed if a suitable HLA-matched related or unrelated donor is identified before
             receiving the allogeneic transplantation and if the patient meets the eligibility
             criteria of the subsequent study

             regimen

          -  Expected survival &gt;= 3 months from study entry

          -  DONOR: HLA genotypically or phenotypically identical related donor

          -  DONOR: must consent to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim)
             administration and leukapheresis for both PBSC allograft and subsequent donor
             lymphocyte infusion (DLI)

          -  DONOR: must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of central
             venous catheter (femoral or subclavian)

          -  DONOR: Age &lt; 75 yrs, older donors may be considered after review at Patient Care
             Conference

          -  DONOR: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) matching allowed will be Grades
             1.0 to 2.1; unrelated donors who are prospectively: Matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and
             DQB1 by high resolution typing; only a single allele disparity will be allowed for
             HLA-A, B, or C as defined by high resolution typing

          -  DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
             jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the
             standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for
             patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients
             before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell
             cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of
             the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I
             allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be
             obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is
             an absolute donor exclusion

          -  DONOR: patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft
             rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101
             and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  DONOR: Only G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) only will be
             permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients are adults or children with evidence for the existence of a tumor of the adrenal
        glands, as indicated by previously obtained imaging studies and/or biochemical
        investigation of hormonal secretion.  This condition is meant to include the possibility
        of individuals with "sub-clinical" hormone secretion syndromes, which may be detectable at
        the biochemical level even in the absence of frank clinical signs/symptoms.

        All eligible patients are invited to participate in this protocol, regardless of sex, race
        or ethnic origin.  All populations appear at risk for adrenal tumors, and therefore the
        subject population can include Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Caucasian,
        Hispanic, and Black individuals.  Patients will be accepted for evaluation based on
        referral from clinicians, or may be self-referred, if they can provide evidence supportive
        of the diagnosis of hormone over-secretion.

        Patients must be willing to return to the NIH for follow-up evaluation.

        Patients may withdraw from the study at any time.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Children less than 3 years old will be excluded from the protocol because of the
             limited resources available at the NIH for the care of infants of this age.

          2. Individuals over the age of 70 years of age will be excluded because of the
             possibility of comorbidities that may significantly affect appropriate initial
             work-up and post-operative management. In addition, research data may be compromised
             by the inability to interpret data collected from patients over the age of 70 years
             that may be on multiple medications for a variety for reasons.

          3. Women who are pregnant or nursing will be excluded from the hyperaldosteronism arm of
             the protocol. Women with adrenal tumors secreting cortisol or other adrenal hormones
             may benefit clinically from evaluation and treatment of their tumor, and will be
             considered for enrollment when clinically indicated.

          4. Individuals whose medical status will not allow them, for safety reasons, to
             participate in the provocative testing or who have unacceptably high risk for
             surgical morbidity and mortality will be excluded from the protocol, as they will not
             be able to participate profitably in the research aspects of this protocol.

          5. Individuals found to have an known inherited syndrome as the cause for hormone
             oversecretion will be excluded from participation in this protocol, as the mechanisms
             of hormone oversecretion and tumorigenesis is likely to be distinct in these
             individuals. Specific examples of syndromes to may be excluded from this protocol
             include individuals with Carney Complex, McCune-Albright syndrome, and MEN-1.  If
             inquiries are received from such patients, they will be referred to the appropriate
             ongoing protocols, if possible.

        Pregnant women are excluded only from any procedure or test that may endanger the
        pregnancy or the fetus due to the risk from radiographic studies, anesthesia, or certain
        biopsies.

        Coronary CT angiography will not be performed on any patient with contraindication to IV
        contrast media.  This includes patients with: 1) creatinine value of greater than 1.3
        mg/dl, 2) history of multiple myeloma, 3) use of metformin-containing products less than
        24 hours prior to contrast media, and 4) history of significant allergic reaction to CT

        they may be referred by their physician or self-referred.  If possible, a local
        physician/clinical immunologist will be identified for self-referred patients to serve as
        primary reference.  If screening of the patients, either by phone interview or review of
        their medical records indicates that the patient may have a primary immunodeficiency
        syndrome and is HIV-negative, the patient will be invited to come to the NIH and sign an

        CAEBV PATIENTS

        Study size: up to 150 patients

        Sex distribution: male and female

        Age range:no minimum nor maximum age

        Patients with known or suspected CAEBV and their relatives will be recruited by referrals
        from health care providers.  The rarity of this disease will markedly limit the number of
        patients available to study.

        Patient recruitment is irrespective of racial and ethnic group or gender.  NIAID
        investigators will be available to answer questions and discuss general aspects of CAEBV
        and identified genes or modifier genes with participants or their providers.

        Eligibility criteria:

        To be considered having CAEBV, a patient must have:

          1. a severe progressive illness that began as a primary EBV infection, or associated
             with postive  EBV-specific antibody titers (IgG-VCA greater than or equal to ; EA or
             EBNA not otherwise explained AND

          2. evidence of  major organ involvement such as lymphadenitis, hemophagocytosis,
             meningoencephalitis, persistent hepatitis, splenomegaly, interstitial pneumonitis,
             bone marrow hypoplasia, uveitis AND

          3. detection of elevated levels of EBV DNA, RNA or proteins in affected tissues OR
             elevated levels of EBV DNA in the peripheral blood

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (a) Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient
        unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient participating in the study.

        RELATIVES OF CAEBV PATIENTS

        Study size: up to 150 relatives of CAEBV patients

        Age range:  2 years and above

        To determine the genetic basis for this syndrome, the evaluation of blood, saliva and/or
        previously obtained tissue specimens from healthy relatives of CAEBV patients will serve
        as controls.  No tissue biopsies will be performed on healthy relatives. We will

        perform some or all of the studies listed in section V. on samples from normal relatives.

        UNRELATED VOLUNTEERS

        Study size: up to 300 persons

        Age range: 18 years and above

        Panels of anonymous blood samples will be obtained through NIH Clinical Center Blood
        Transfusion Medicine to determine if identified genetic changes are mutations or
        polymorphisms.

        Study population:

        Patients must be members of families with familial TGCT as defined below.

        Definition of familial TGCT:

        The criterion establishing familial TGCT is the presence of:

        -at least two cases of documented GCT in blood relatives (at least one of which is
        testicular in origin),

        OR

          -  a single family member with bilateral testicular cancer,

          -  men with a history of TGCT who are one in a set of identical siblings will also be
             included in the study.

        Case definition:

        A case will be determined to have TGCT according to the following criteria:

          -  Pathologic confirmation of a germ cell   derived tumor arising in the testis.
             Extragonadal germ cell tumors will also be included.

          -  Germ cell   derived histologies including: seminoma, germinoma, embryonal carcinoma,
             endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumor, gonadoblastoma, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, and
             mixed germ cell tumor.

          -  A case will be determined to have TIN on the basis of pathologic confirmation of
             intratubular malignant germ cells (ITMGCs) as defined by Burke and Mostofi.

        Individuals from participating families who are eligible for this study include:

        i)   all TGCT cases;

        ii)   All GCT cases (including those of ovarian or extra-gonadal sites);

        iii)  all first-degree relatives of each TGCT case;

        iv) the spouse(s) of every case if the spouse and case had children who are participating
        in the study;

        v)  any blood relative not included in (ii - iii) above who genetically links two cases;
        and

        vi)   any blood relative with cancer other than TGCT

        vii)  family members as described in i) - v) above must be age 12 or greater in order to
        participate

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Families will be deemed ineligible for participation in this study if:

        There are not at least two proven cases of GCT in the family, one of which is testicular
        in origin, unless there is a family member with bilateral testicular cancer;

        Deceased TGCT cases lacking both archival sources of tissue for DNA extraction AND lacking
        surviving spouses and children who are willing to paricipate in the study (unavailability
        of such persons prohibits inferring the genotype of the deceased individual with TGCT).

        Critical informative family members are unwilling to participate (i.e., unwilling to
        provide written informed consent);

        On referral, persons of any age will be considered for inclusion in the study because of
        either:

          -  A family or personal medical history of hematologic/ lymphoproliferative malignancy
             of any unusual type, pattern, or number; or,

          -  Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to hematologic malignancy, either genetic
             and/or congenital factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies
             or Mendelian traits associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications,
             occupation, radiation, diet, infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic
             features (very young age of onset multiple tumors, etc.).

        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,
        and review of pathology slides and medical records.  For familial neoplasms, two or more
        living affected cases among family members are generally required, although in selected
        instances exceptions may be made, e.g., for WM, one cases plus a living 1st degree
        relative with an autoimmune condition will qualify a family for further investigations.

        Familial aggregation of any hematologic cancer(s) is eligible for study, our current
        active accrual efforts fall into 5 categories

          1. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

          2. Waldenstrom   s macroglobulinemia (WM)

          3. Non-Hodgkin   s Lymphoma (NHL)

          4. Hodgkin disease (HD)

        Individuals age 18 and over are considered for inclusion in the study if they have a:

        Family history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number which includes breast
        cancer or is consistent with an identified or suspected familial cancer syndrome which
        includes breast and/or ovarian cancer,

        Personal history of neoplasia(s) or benign conditions of an unusual type or with unusual
        demographic features (young age of onset, multiple primary sites, rare tumor type of
        pathologic characteristics) consistent with an identified or suspected familial cancer
        syndrome which includes breast and/or ovarian cancer, or

        A known mutation associated with one of the breast/ovarian cancer family syndromes.

        Eligibility is now restricted to only bloodline individuals age 18 and over from families
        which are already enrolled in 02-C-0212 and in which there is a known BRCA mutation

        Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews,
        and review of pathology slides and medical records. For known or suspected familial
        syndromes in which no gene has been identified, two or more living affected cases among
        family members are required for participation. The types of familial syndromes under
        active accrual and study are predominantly investigator-and hypothesis-driven. This
        approach permits CGB investigators to remain alert to the opportunities afforded by
        unexpected clusters of rare tumors in families and individuals, and to tailor the accrual
        of families with specific types of syndromes to meet programmatic goals. This requires
        that CGB investigators remain abreast of both general knowledge and state-of the-art
        developments in clinical oncology, genetics, epidemiology and molecular biology, so that
        critical research opportunities can be recognized when they present, and so that
        thoughtful decisions can be made regarding the commitment of the resources needed to
        conduct such studies.

        patient may decline to have a bone marrow biopsy if the bone marrow sample is only for
        research purposes.

        Bone marrow biopsy will be performed on children only if medically indicated.  Research

        All subjects must meet the established diagnostic criteria for hypereosinophilic syndrome:
        eosinophilia greater than 1,500/mm(3) on two occasions, no secondary etiology for the
        eosinophilia despite careful clinical evaluation, and evidence of end organ damage
        (histologic evidence of tissue infiltration by eosinophils and/or objective evidence of
        clinical pathology in any organ system that is temporally associated with eosinophilia and
        not clearly attributable to another cause).

        All subjects must fit one of the following three categories:

          1. refractory to or intolerant of steroids

          2. presence of FIP1L1/PDGFRA by RT-PCR

          3. presence of greater than or equal to 4 of the following laboratory criteria
             suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder:

        i.     dysplastic eosinophils on peripheral smear

        ii.    serum B12 level greater than or equal to 1000 pg/ml

        iii.   serum tryptase level greater than or equal to 12

        iv.   anemia and/or thrombocytopenia

        v.    bone marrow cellularity greater than 80% with left shift in maturation

        vi.   dysplastic (spindle-shaped) mast cells on bone marrow biopsy

        vii.  evidence of fibrosis on bone marrow biopsy

        viii. dysplastic megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy

        3. All subjects must be at least 2 years of age.

        4. Negative serum beta-hCG within 24 hours prior to drug administration for women of
        childbearing potential to exclude early pregnancy.

        5. All subjects (men and women) must agree to practice abstinence or effective
        contraception during administration of imatinib mesylate and for 6 months after
        discontinuation of drug.

        Of note, failure of the standard chemotherapeutic agents (steroids, hydroxyurea, and
        interferon alpha) will not be a prerequisite for participation in this protocol for the
        following reasons. 1) There is no approved therapy for HES. 2) Steroid therapy in the
        myeloproliferative subset of HES patients is generally ineffective. 3) Although
        hydroxyurea and interferon alpha are initially effective in most cases, a majority of
        patients become refractory to or intolerant of these agents within a relatively short
        period of time (less than 1 year). 4) Data from other myeloproliferative disorders,
        including CML, suggest that interferon and imatinib mesylate, but not hydroxyurea, are
        associated with cytogenetic remission. 5) The reported incidence and severity of side
        effects from imatinib mesylate in patients with CML appears comparable to (or less than)
        those associated with interferon alpha.

        Although a private physician is not required for inclusion in the study, it is strongly
        recommended that all subjects have a physician outside the NIH for routine medical care
        and emergencies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Pregnancy or nursing women

          2. HIV positivity or other known immunodeficiency

          3. D816V KIT-positive systemic mastocytosis

          4. Absolute neutrophil count less than 1000/mm(3) or platelet count less than
             10,000/mm(3) or less than 50,000/m(3) with clinical evidence of bleeding.

          5. Elevated transaminases (greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal) or elevated
             bilirubin (greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal)

          6. Any condition that, in the investigator   s opinion, places the patient at undue risk

             Dyscrasia; lymphoproliferative disorders (Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Hairy Cell Leukemia,
             Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and Hodgkin's Disease). Diagnosis of myelodysplastic
             disorders which is not good risk by IPSS: Fanconi's Anemia; Acute Myelogenous
             Leukemia (1st or subsequent relapse, or 2nd or subsequent CR, or refractory disease);
             Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in 2nd or subsequent remission or relapse or refractory
             disease; Philadelphia Chromosome-positive Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (failed STI
             and interferon); Multiple Myeloma (Stage II or III); Lymphoma; Chronic Lymphocytic
             Leukemia (primary refractory or recurrent disease); Hodgkin's Disease (after
             relapse); Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (failed chemotherapy and/or anti-viral
             therapy); bone marrow failure such as Aplastic Anemia and Paroxysmal Nocturnal
             Hemoglobinuria; PNH (failed prior therapies).

          2. Conditions that increase treatment related mortality: (need one or more to be
             eligible): Age &gt; / = 50 years; EF of less than 45%; DLCO less than 50% or FEVI 50-75%
             of predicted value; Diabetes Mellitus; Renal Insufficiency (but creatinine clearance
             not less than 25 mL/min); Prior recent history of systemic fungal infection; 3rd or
             greater remission of AML or ALL; Significant Grade III or IV neurologic or hepatic
             toxicity from previous treatment; More than 1 year from diagnosis (CML or Myeloma
             patients ONLY); Multiple types of treatment regimens (equal to or more than 3);
             Significant Grade III or IV neurologic or hepatic toxicity from previous treatment;
             Prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          3. Haploidentical family member donor. This protocol is open to patients who lack a 5/6
             or 6/6 HLA antigen-matched donor. Due to the increased risk of GvHD, patients with
             Fanconi Anemia and a 5/6 HLA match will also be eligible.

             For this protocol, the "best" donor will be defined as a first-degree haploidentical
             family member who matches at the greatest number of MHC loci. Matching will be
             determined by Class I and Class II DNA typing. The donor should be sufficiently
             healthy as to not be at increased risk from the stem cell mobilization procedure.
             Should more than one "equally" MHC-incompatible donor be identified, other selection
             criteria will include: age and size of donor, CMV status, and sex. The Principal
             Investigator will make final decisions.

          4. Available healthy donor without any contraindications for donation.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Age: greater than or equal to 1 years and less than or equal to 21 years.

               2. Radiographic diagnosis:  Patients must have a brain tumor (including, but not
                  limited to high grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas, primitive neuroectodermal
                  tumors, ependymomas) or residual abnormality (e.g. post-operatively or
                  post-radiation) that is measurable or evaluable on standard MRI or CT.

               3. All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than 18 years of
                  age) must sign a document of informed consent indicating their awareness of the
                  investigational nature and the risks of this study.  When appropriate, the minor
                  patient will be asked for oral assent.  The parent or guardian will sign the
                  consent form on the designated line attesting to the fact that the minor has
                  given assent.

               4. Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): A DPA will be offered to all patients 18-21
                  years of age.

               5. Prior treatment:  Patients will be eligible for this study regardless of prior
                  treatment, as long as they meet other eligibility criteria.  Therefore, patients
                  who are newly diagnosed, post-operative, post-radiation or post-chemotherapy are
                  eligible.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients under age 18 years who weigh greater than 70 kg are excluded because they
             would exceed the standard allowable dosimetry for pediatric patients (i.e. Effective
             Dose greater than 0.5 REM/year).  In addition, patients who weigh greater than 136 kg
             are excluded, as this is the maximum weight allowable on PET scanner tables.

          2. Pregnant women are excluded because the effects from the magnet on the fetus are
             unknown.  In addition, gadolinium is not approved for use in pregnant women, because
             its teratogenic effects have not been studied and we wish to avoid radiation exposure
             to the fetus.

          3. Any patient who is unable (either because of physical or psychological factors) to
             undergo imaging studies without sedation but is not considered an anesthesia
             candidate.

          4. Any patient with a metallic MRI incompatible implant, including cardiac pacemakers,
             neural pacemakers, aneurysmal clips, shrapnel, cochlear implants or ferrous surgical

             to 2) to Gadolinium or other contrast agents.

          6. Any patient with Diabetes mellitus or steroid-induced hyperglycemia (fasting glucose
             greater than 150) because this may interfere with the interpretation of the
             [(18)F]-FDG PET scan.

          7. Any patient with permanent braces, permanent retainers or nonferrous implant that, in
             the judgment of the Principal Investigator, would interfere with obtaining
             spectroscopy in the area of the tumor.

              14. Adequate central venous access potential.

              15. Potential patients referred for the study may not be eligible for the
                  experimental protocol therapy due to reasons such as uncertainty about donor HLA
                  typing or need to control malignant disease, infection, or metabolic abnormality
                  such as hypercalcemia on a emergent basis.  Should a referred patient present to
                  us in such a scenario, the patient will be referred back to their primary
                  hematologist-oncologist for treatment.  However, if referral back to the
                  referring physician is not in the best interest of the patient according to the
                  clinical judgement of the PI, then the patient may receive standard treatment
                  for the malignant disease or complicating conditions (infection, metabolic
                  problems under the current study. In other cases, a patient may have reasonable
                  control of malignancy but does not meet the CD4 cell cut-off of 50 cells per
                  microliter required for cohort 3 therapy; in such cases, standard care
                  chemotherapy regimens may be administered for the specific goal of reducing the
                  CD4 count (that is, immune depleting regimens such as the pentostatin plus
                  cyclophosphamide combination, administered similar to the manner that we have
                  developed on protocol 08-C- 0088). If it becomes apparent that the patient will
                  not be able to proceed to experimental therapy, then he/she must come off study.
                   Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard therapy, and availability of receiving
                  the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol.  Because such
                  standard care therapy is not experimental, it is not necessary to complete the
                  eligibility criteria prior to receiving such standard care; however, prior to
                  initiation of the experimental therapy, the patient must meet each of the
                  eligibility crieteria detailed above. Attempts will be made to standardize such
                  pretransplant

        chemotherapy (by administration of EPOCH-FR chemotherapy, which is detailed later in this
        protocol); however, other regimens using approved agents will be allowed if such regimens
        are thought to be in the best interest of the patient.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: DONOR

          1. First-degree relative with genotypic identity at 6/6 HLA loci (HLA- A, B, and DR).

          2. Age 11 to 90 years and able to give consent or assent. For donors &lt;  18 years old,
             the legal guardian must be able to provide informed consent.

          3. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary
             central venous catheter for apheresis.

          4. Donors must be HIV negative.

          5. Donors with a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection may be eligible.
             However, eligibility determination of such patients will require a hepatology
             consultation. The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting
             hepatitis will be discussed with the patient and eligibility will then be determined
             by the principal investigator and LAI.

          6. Lactating donors must substitute formula feeding for her infant during period of
             filgrastim administration (to prevent any filgrastim effect on infant).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: PATIENT

          1. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          2. Active CNS involvement by malignancy.

          3. HIV infection (treatment may result in progression of HIV and other viral
             infections).

          4. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For
             patients with concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patient will require
             a hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis B
             will be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the principal
             investigator and Lead Associate Investigator.

          5. Hepatitis C infection. Patient may have hepatitis C infection. However, each patient
             will require a hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and
             hepatitis C will be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the
             principal investigator and Lead Associate Investigator.

          6. Pregnant or lactating.  Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective
             method of contraception. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant
             and the medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a
             fetus. The effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may be harmful to the
             infant.

          7. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: DONOR

          1. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          2. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, autoimmune
             disease, or severe heart disease (donors with symptomatic angina will be excluded).
             Donors with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty who are
             symptom free will receive a cardiology evaluation and be considered on a case-by-case
             basis.

          3. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis. In
             addition, donors with localized cancer such as prostate cancer that are on a
             watch-and-wait management due to the low-risk of disease progression may also be
             considered for stem cell donation on a case-by-case basis. The risk/benefit of the
             transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells at the time of
             transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          4. Donors must not be pregnant (unknown effect of filgrastim on fetus).  Donors of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception.

          5. Anemia (Hb less than 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000 per
             microliter).  However, potential donors with Hb levels less than 11 gm/dl that is due
             to iron deficiency will be eligible as long as the donor is initiated on iron
             replacement therapy and the case is individually approved by NIH or Hackensack Blood
             Bank.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with podocyte diseases, MCD, FSGS (including primary, secondary, and
             adaptive variants), and CG (including HIV-associated variant), who meet the following
             criteria:

          -  An adequate renal biopsy, defined as having minimum 10 glomeruli for light microscopy
             and minimum 3 glomeruli for electron microscopy, unless the podocyte disease is
             diagnostic on fewer glomeruli.  Patients who have non-diagnostic or technically
             inadequate biopsies will be offered the opportunity to undergo a research biopsy to
             determine eligibility.  For some patients who have had a non-diagnostic or
             technically inadequate biopsy, a repeat renal biopsy may be clinically indicated in
             an effort to diagnose and treat a potentially serious kidney disease.

          -  Greater than or equal to 16 years of age. The rationale for excluding younger
             children is that retinoids may carry greater toxicity in children, as there are
             reports of premature epiphyseal closure, development of slender long bones, and
             periostial thickening.

          -  Prior treatment with at least two immunosuppressive agents that have been shown to
             induce remission in MCD and FSGS: glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus,
             cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and mycophenolate mofetil. Therapy with each agent
             must last at least 8 weeks. Exemptions will be made for those with contraindications
             to these medications or those who cannot tolerate these medications. The rationale is
             to recruit patients who have failed conventional therapy.  All patients will be off
             immunosuppression for at least 4 weeks before starting retiniods in order to avoid a
             confounding effect.

          -  Three first void urine protein/creatinine ratios &gt;  2 g/g obtained within one month
             prior to enrolling in the study. These urine collections will be obtained after the
             patient has been on a stable dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 4 weeks (the
             maximal antiproteinuric effect of these medications occurs after 4 weeks). The
             rationale is that patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria are at high risk for
             progressive renal disease, justifying participation in a clinical trial with novel
             agents. Patients with steroid-sensitive frequently relapsing MCD will not be required
             to have used ACE inhibitor or ARB, as steroids alone are typically sufficient therapy
             to induce remission.

          -  If hypertensive: blood pressure of less than or equal to 140/90 on a stable dose of
             ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least 1 month or greater than or equal to 75 percent of
             measurements before the entry of the study. The rationale is that uncontrolled
             hypertension can exacerbate proteinuria.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or unwillingness to use at least two contraceptive methods
             (at least one of which must be primary, including tubal ligation, partner vasectomy,
             oral contraceptives, implanted contraceptives, and intrauterine device). The
             rationale is that retinoids are teratogenic and are excreted in breast milk.

          -  Abnormal liver function test, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or protime. The
             rationale is that retinoids can be hepatotoxic. The only exception will be the
             following: if the cause of abnormality of LFTs is felt to be due to a specific
             hepatotoxic drug such as a statin and the levels are less than 2 times the upper
             limit of the normal AND normalize upon holding the offending drug, patients may be
             considered for study participation after consultation with hepatology service.

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia greater than 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy. The
             rationale is that retinoids can increase lipids, particularly triglyceride as this
             can lead to pancreatitis.

          -  Any medical conditions requiring concurrent immunosuppression, as this pilot study is
             designed to evaluate the effect of retinoids as a monotherapy.

          -  Any medical conditions requiring concurrent use of tetracycline, minocycline, or
             doxycycline, due to enhanced risk of increased intracranial pressure.

          -  Hypersensitivity to retinoids.

          -  Presence of any unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes with
             hemoglobin A1c greater than 8 percent, chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions
             except HIV-1 infection. Retinoids have been associated with chest pain of unclear
             etiology, increased serum glucose, myelosuppression and increased risk of infection.
             The etiology of infection is not clear but may be related to myelosuppression.

          -  Those with HIV-1 infection must not have any evidence for opportunistic infectious
             complications and have CD4 count greater than or equal to 200. Both tretinoin and
             isotretinoin have been safely studied in HIV-infected patients for other indications.

          -  GFR less than 40 ml/min/1.73m(2)estimated by 5-variable MDRD equation, as the
             metabolities of retinoids are excreted in part in urine, and there is a concern for
             increased toxicity. In participants less than 18 years of age, we will use Schwartz
             equation.

          -  Expansion of glomerulus or interstitial formation on the biopsy.

          -  Untreated depression, as retinoids have been associated with depression, suicidal
             ideation, and aggressive behavior. If patients manifest significant depressive
             symptoms, they will be included in the study only if assessed and agreed by a
             psychiatrist (either at NIH or other) and if they have regular follow-up visits with
             a psychiatrist.

          -  Factors that increase the risk of renal biopsy. These include the following:
             unwillingness to accept blood transfusion, bleeding diathesis, single kidney, small
             kidneys (less than 9.5 cm).

                  or with disease relapse within 12 months after completing therapy with a
                  fludarabine (or another nucleoside analog) containing regimen

               -  Failed FCR or pentostatin/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (PCR) combination
                  chemotherapy at any time point

               -  Patients with novo or acquired "17p deletion" cytogenetic abnormality; patients
                  should have received induction treatment but could be transplanted in 1st CR

          -  Patients who have suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated
             donors willing to receive filgrastim (G-CSF), undergo leukapheresis to collect
             peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and to donate stem cells

          -  RELATED DONORS: When more than one potential donor exists, priority should be given
             to donors based on HLA identity &gt; cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegativity &gt; ABO
             compatibility &gt; sex matching

               -  Donor who is HLA phenotypically or genotypically identical at the allele level
                  at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1

               -  Must consent to G-CSF administration and leukapheresis;

               -  Must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of central
                  venous catheter (femoral, subclavian);

                  (HSC) source on this protocol

          -  UNRELATED DONORS:

               -  Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) matching allowed will be Grades
                  1.0 to 2.1; Unrelated donors who are prospectively:

               -  Matched for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high resolution typing

               -  Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined by

          -  UNRELATED DONORS: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified
             that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is
             based on the standard practice of the individual institution; recommended procedure
             for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody screens to class I and II antigens for all patients before HCT; if
             the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross
             matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic
             cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I allele
             mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained
             regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an
             absolute donor exclusion

          -  UNRELATED DONORS: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the
             graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is
             A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  UNRELATED DONORS: Only G-CSF mobilized PBMC will be permitted as a HSC source on this
             protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

             defined by pulmonary consultant service; and the FHCRC principal investigator (PI) of
             the study must approve of enrollment of all patients with pulmonary nodules

          -  Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for
             the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, and the
             degree of portal hypertension; patients will be excluded if they are found to have
             fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension,
             hepatic damage with bridging fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a

             not require therapy

          -  Patients with a history of non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin
             cancers) currently in a complete remission, who are less than 5 years from the time

             are not considered to indicate disease acceleration.

         10. ( Cont # 8) We have recently found clonal evolution to have a variable prognostic
             impact and may be suppressed with IFN-a therapy. Hence these patients, like others
             with de novo accelerated phase, will be eligible, and analyzed separately.

             allogeneic stem cell transplantation for a hematological malignancy.

          -  For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia
             chromosome or persistence of BCR/ABL rearrangements by molecular testing on at least
             two measurements over a 6 month interval.  If cytogenetics are normal and there is
             PCR evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have evidence of
             a quantitative increase in CML measured either by quantitative PCR or by fluorescent
             in situ hybridization (FISH).

          -  For non-CML, relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic criteria
             from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific
             cytogenetics.  For disease specific definition of relapse, see appendix 3.  Relapse
             can be determined morphologically with less than 5 percent blasts if definitive
             relapse can be determined.  Equivocal results for relapse should result in a repeated
             test after an appropriate time interval (suggested 1 month) to determine eligibility.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or lactating. The agents used in this study may be
             teratogenic to a fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into
             breast milk All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine
             study within 2 weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy

   Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The proposal is to include as many patients with PT as possible including previously

             eligible assuming they meet the diagnostic criteria and they do not have any
             exclusion criterion (see below). It will be necessary to stratify patients according
             to their previous treatment. This information will be collected on entry to the
             study. Informed consent is of course required where there is a change of therapeutic
             strategy.

        The diagnostic criteria for primary thrombocythaemia are:

          -  Platelet count &gt; 600x109/l.

          -  No evidence of overt polycythaemia(confirmed by RCM if necessary)or of polycythaemia
             masked by co-existent iron deficiency.

          -  No Philadelphia chromosome.

          -  Absence of peripheral blood and/or marrow appearances of myelodysplasia, or
             myelofibrosis.

          -  No known cause of reactive thrombocytosis. Particular care should be taken to exclude
             iron deficiency in pre-menopausal women.

        Notes:

          -  In asymptomatic patients, the platelet count should be observed for a period of at
             least 2 months to confirm &gt;600x109/l, and to allow any cause of reactive
             thrombocytosis to become overt.

          -  If the PCV is above normal upper limit (that is, males &gt;0.51, females &gt;0.48) or in
             high normal range in a patient with palpable splenomegaly measure RCM. Iron deficient
             primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia vera) is strongly suggested if Hb/PCV is normal
             in the presence of iron deficient red cell changes. In this situation, iron therapy
             is potentially dangerous.

          -  Exceeding rarely, bcr-abl positive Philadelphia chromosome negative patients present
             with high platelet counts with little or no elevation in WBC count. The features that
             suggest it is necessary to examine for bcr-abl, are:- basophilia, left-shift in WBC,
             granulocyte count &gt;16x109/l, difficulty in controlling platelet count, megakaryocytes
             of low ploidy (NAP is usually unhelpful).

          -  A normal ESR, CRP or plasma viscosity is useful in excluding a reactive
             thrombocytosis.

          -  Written informed consent obtained in accordance with NCRI requirements.

          -  Patients with impaired hepatic / renal function are not excluded although the
             respective biochemical tests should be monitored during therapy and reduced doses of
             cytoreductive agent should be used, particularly in the case of hydroxyurea and renal
             dysfunction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        High risk features (any of the following):

          -  Age &gt;or= 60 years

          -  Platelet count &gt; or= 1500x109/l (current or previous) (a)

          -  History of ischaemia, thrombosis or embolic events (including erythromelalgia) (b)

          -  Haemorrhage considered to be related to PT (b)

          -  Presence of hypertension (c)or diabetes (d)

          -  The manufacturers of hydroxyurea state that it should be avoided in pregnancy and in
             lactating women. Similarly, hydroxyurea  should not be prescribed for women when
             there is doubt about their use of an effective contraceptive method.

          -  Exclude patient from hydroxyurea therapy and, therefore, from the 'intermediate' risk
             randomisation if the patient has current leg ulcers.

        Notes on the definition of high risk:

          -  In patients with borderline counts the allocation of a patient to a high risk group
             based on platelet count alone should rely on at least three samples taken on separate
             occasions over at least 2 months.

          -  Documentation of previous thrombo-embolic, ischaemic and haemorrhagic events should
             be given on the patient's entry proforma.

          -  Hypertension is defined as those patients requiring hypotensive therapy.

          -  Diabetes is defined as those patients requiring therapy with a hypoglycaemic agent.

               -  Stage IV breast cancer in a complete remission (bone only not allowed unless the
                  bone scan is normal).

          2. The patient must have had what is considered standard adjuvant systemic therapy that
             may include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and radiation therapy.  They may have
             undergone high dose chemotherapy with stem cell support as part of their therapy in
             the adjuvant or metastatic setting. The patient is allowed to continue to take
             adjuvant hormonal therapy (for high risk adjuvant patients) and may be allowed to be
             on hormonal consolidation post transplant if they are without evidence of disease
             after a transplant for metastatic breast cancer. The patient cannot be actively
             receiving chemotherapy or any biologic agent to treat their breast cancer.

          3. Six weeks must elapse from last chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

          4. The patient must have had definitive surgical therapy for their breast cancer. This
             includes lumpectomy and axillary dissection or mastectomy.

          5. No clinical or radiologic evidence of disease after surgery and/or systemic treatment
             (by CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis and bone scan or PET scan prior to
             enrollment)

          6. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of TM in
             patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.

          7. ECOG performance status &lt; 1

          8. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          9. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  hemoglobin &gt;10mg/dL

             treated medically for their peripheral neuropathy.

         13. Concurrent herceptin is not allowed.

         14. The effects of TM on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this reason, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

         15. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 6 weeks prior to entering
             the study.

          2. Objective evidence of breast cancer.

          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to TM.

          6. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because TM has the potential to have
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with TM,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with TM.

          7. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with TM.

   Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants in the Lung Cancer Case Registry will be all patients
             diagnosed or evaluated for possible treatment of lung cancer at the CRTC and NMVHCS.
             Recruiting will primarily be performed through the Multidisciplinary Chest Clinics
             held weekly at each hospital. These clinics are staffed by the Principal Investigator
             (PI) and Reza Mehran, MD, a thoracic surgeon at both hospitals and a co-investigator
             on this submission. Approximately 90% of all lung cancer cases diagnosed at the
             NMVHCS, and a somewhat smaller proportion of cases treated in the Cancer Center, are
             seen in these clinics. Additional cases will be identified through review of new
             patient visits to each hospital with a diagnosis of lung cancer; Drs. Crowell and
             Mehran also maintain weekly contact with pathology and oncology services at both
             facilities, which will facilitate case identification at NMVHCS and University
             Hospital. Finally, patient contact records will be correlated with tumor registry
             records at both hospitals, which will identify any cases not captured through the
             above mechanisms. Although these cases may be identified several weeks after initial
             diagnosis, all attempts will still be made to contact the patient and family for
             enrollment into the registry. Most Spanish-speaking patients served by the CRTC and
             the NMVHCS are bilingual, and a language barrier has not been a problem in other
             similar studies conducted by the PI. However, Spanish-speaking personnel are
             available to obtain consent and answer any questions if necessary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they cannot provide written informed consent.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented metastatic colorectal
             cancer, which has recurred or progressed following at least one prior chemotherapy
             regimen administered for the treatment of metastatic disease.  The diagnosis should
             be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology at the Clinical Center, NIH.

          -  Tumor should express EGFR, defined as any membrane staining for EGFR in tumor cells
             by immunohistochemistry (IHC) done on archival tumor blocks or slides.

          -  Tumor blocks or unstained slides from archival pathological specimen suitable for the
             isolation of genomic DNA must be available to determine the status of mutations in
             KRAS in the tumor. (For the initial 13 evaluable patients already enrolled and
             treated on this study, every effort will be made to re-acquire these blocks from
             patients or their referring physicians for evaluation of KRAS.)

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or
             equal to 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have received or been offered and declined at least one prior
             5FU-containing combination chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease, unless
             available chemotherapy regimens were for some reason contraindicated for a particular
             patient. Patients who have received chemotherapy and/or biologic therapy, excluding
             BAY 43-9006 or cetuximab, are eligible. This therapy must have been completed greater
             than or equal to 4 weeks prior to enrollment on protocol, and the patient must have
             recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity. Prior radiation or surgery
             should have been completed greater than or equal to 4 weeks prior to study enrollment
             and all associated toxicities resolved to eligibility levels.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years.  Colorectal cancer does not usually occur in
             patients less than 18 years of age.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/ microliter

          -  total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of
             normal

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of
             normal

          -  creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal

        OR

          -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)

          -  PT/PTT less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal

          -  Patients must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy, as determined by an
             associate investigator after discussion with a member of the interventional radiology
             team.  This lesion should be different from target lesion(s) being followed on
             imaging studies to evaluate response to treatment.

          -  The effects of the combination of BAY 43-9006 and cetuximab on the developing human
             fetus at the recommended therapeutic doses are unknown.  For this reason and because
             raf kinase inhibitor agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration
             of study participation, and for at least 2 months following completion of study.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             and the ability to comply with daily oral self administration schedule.

          -  Patients must have systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 150 mm Hg and
             diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg.  Concomitant antihypertensive
             medications to achieve control of blood pressure are allowed.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
             prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered to at least eligibility
             levels from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
             Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent
             administered as part of a Phase    0    study (also referred to as an    early Phase
             I study    or    pre-Phase I study    where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is
             administered) at the PI   s discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility
             levels from any toxicities

          -  Patients who have received any other investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered to at least eligibility levels
             from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases would be excluded from this clinical trial, with
             the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status remains stable for
             greater than or equal to 6 months after treatment of the brain metastases without
             steroids or anti seizure medications. These patients may be enrolled at the
             discretion of the principal investigator.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to BAY 43-9006 (for example, other multi-targeted kinase inhibitors, such
             as sunitinib) or cetuximab (for example, other drugs containing murine proteins, such
             as bevacizumab) used in the study.

          -  Prior therapy with cetuximab or BAY 43-9006.

          -  Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation are excluded.  Prophylactic anticoagulation
             (i.e. low dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided
             that the requirements for PT, INR or PTT are met.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             serious infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 43-9006 is a kinase inhibitor
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with BAY 43-9006, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with  BAY 43-9006.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from this study
             due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions between anti-retroviral
             medications and BAY 43-9006.  HIV positive patients not receiving antiretroviral
             therapy are excluded due to the possibility that BAY 43-9006 may worsen their
             condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the
             attribution of adverse events with respect to BAY 43-9006.

          -  History of another malignancy within the past 5 years, apart from adequately treated
             non-melanoma skin cancers, superficial bladder cancer or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Patients with conditions that would impair their ability to swallow tablets are
             excluded.

          -  Use of the following medications will be not be allowed within 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment on the study and during the study: ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir,
             cyclosporine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, St. Johns Wort, and
             prophylactic use of filgrastim and sargramostim. Products containing grapefruit juice
             will not be allowed while on study. BAY 43-9006 tosylate is metabolized by the P450
             CYP3A enzyme; therefore, it is possible that BAY 43-9006 tosylate may interact with
             the above medications.  Efforts should be made to switch patients who are taking
             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents to other medications.

          -  Patients in whom resection is indicated and can be performed safely (unless surgery
             is declined by the patient for other reasons).

          -  For the optional PET/CT imaging with (89)Zr-panitumumab correlative study,
             participants with severe claustrophobia not relieved by oral anxiolytic medication or
             patients weighing &gt; 136 kg (weight limit for scanner table).

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All patients over the age of 18 presenting to the SCHI with upper GI signs or symptoms
        requiring upper GI endoscopy over a defined calendar period (depending on prevalence of
        premalignant lesions, but estimated to be approximately 3 years) will be potentially
        eligible for participation in this study.

        Patients are eligible only if they meet one of the following two conditions: (1) a visible
        lesion unlikely to be cancer or (2) no visible lesions on routine endoscopy (without
        mucosal iodine staining) but an unstained (abnormal) lesion following iodine spraying.

        Invitation for participation will be based solely on the visual appearance of an
        esophageal abnormality without or with mucosal iodine staining, but before histologic
        confirmation is obtained, and will occur during the same clinic visit as the qualifying
        endoscopic examination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will not be invited to participate in this study until after they have undergone
        their routine endoscopic evaluation.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All individuals with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family of
        lung cancer are eligible to enroll their family in the study.  Five major histologic types
        of lung cancer, i.e., adenocardinoma, squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and
        unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma will be included.  In addition to lung cancer
        patients, LSU will also contact patients newly diagnosed with bronchus or tracheal cancer
        in target hospital areas to request their enrollment in their study.  In addition, several
        sites including LSU, Mayo Clinic and Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA samples
        from unaffected, geographically and ethnically matched controls.

        For the purposes of this study, an eligible family must meet the minimum criteria for
        familial lung cancer: at least 2 first-degree relatives in the family have had lung
        cancer.  Priority will be given to more highly loaded pedigrees and to families in which
        the affected persons had onset of the disease at an early age (less than 50 years).  Lung
        cancer cases may be living or deceased.  Relatives with lung cancer are defined as first-
        o second-degree relatives or cousins of index cases will be eligible to participate in the
        study because their familial relationships might provide useful linkage information.

        Adult participants must be physically able to tolerate removal of 25 to 40 ml of blood, or
        buccal brush sampling of their cheek.  Children above 5 years old must be able to
        physically tolerate an amount of blood drawn that is equal to 4ml/kg of their weight.
        Adults must be willing to complete a self-administered environmental exposure
        questionnaire, and all participants must be able to consent to the study procedures (or
        have appropriate assent/parental consent).  Biological specimens, including blood samples,
        archived tumor blocks and other medical records will be obtained from patients treated at
        the various hospitals and collection sites and from individuals with strong family history
        of lung cancer (either affected or unaffected) who have either been self-referred or
        physician referred to the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Excluded from the study are families or individuals within the family who do not meet the
        minimum criteria described above.  Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be
        excluded, and families for whom all necessary members do not sign the Consent Form may be
        excluded.  MAYO also excludes patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are non-US
        citizens or residents and (3) are diagnosed with an uncommon tumor type that is not among
        the above specified types (e.g.) mixed cell or unspecified non-small cell lung cancer,
        carcinoids, sarcomas and lymphomas of the lung and bronchus).  This is done at MAYO
        because the family study is piggy-backed onto a case-control study.  No fetuses, prisoners
        or institutionalized individuals will be enrolled.  While this study does not target
        pregnant women, because contact with many of the families will be by mail we will not be
        able to exclude pregnant women.  Additionally, the participant's own physician or health
        care clinic will draw blood samples from long-distance participants and therefore can
        determine if there is any risk to the woman or her fetus.  UMHS also excludes children as
        research participants in their site.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A patient will be excluded if there is an insufficient quantity of sample available to
        perform the genotyping procedure.  This is not anticipated to be of significance for this
        study since the methodology does not require a large serum sample.

        'High risk' ALL or AML refers to those acute leukemias identified by the presence of
        specific biologic features, which predict high likelihood of failure to conventional
        chemotherapy.  As biologic features of high risk disease evolve with improvement of
        conventional chemotherapy, it is not practical to define this indication with any further
        specificity.  Therefore, high risk AML/ALL will be determined by the primary physician.

             and extranodal, can be irradiated to 30 Gy within the tolerance of the relevant
             normal tissues. If paired organ involvement was regarded as a single extranodal site
             (rather than 2 separate sites and hence stage IV), eligible patients would then be
             regarded as having stage IE or IIE disease. Patients with wider dissemination (bone
             marrow, liver etc) are ineligible.

             treatment-free for 5 years

          -  Such extensive involvement of the thorax that treatment with radiotherapy alone would
             be hazardous because of excessive lung irradiation, even if a shrinking field
             technique were employed

             the standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for
             patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients
             before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell
             cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of
             the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA class I
             allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be
             obtained regardless of the PRA results

   Inclusion Criteria:

        This trial includes only patients who have relapsed after an allogeneic transplant, who
        have either:

          1. No response to conventional DLI given for at least one dose, or

          2. No possibility of access to large number of donor lymphocyte for repeated doses of
             DLI, This applies to cases of unrelated transplant or cord blood transplant

          3. Patients who developed significant GVHD to conventional DLI, but had no other
             therapeutic option. In such cases the rationale is based on mice studies of
             mismatched CIK producing much less GVHD than mismatched unmanipulated splenocytes.

        In view of the period taken to culture the cell to maturity, patient must have a life
        expectancy of more than one month. Interim measures eg chemotherapy or conventional DLI
        will be given during the interval so that ongoing treatment will not be compromised in any
        way.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled infection or significant bleeding

          2. Unstable vital signs

          3. Any degree of hypoxia requiring oxygen therapy.

          3. Patients who fail to engraft or have signs of early relapse after an autologous
             transplant may be considered for this protocol as salvage treatment if they are
             presented to the RMBMTP Clinical Care meeting and the majority of the group agrees
             that this a reasonable treatment option.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients whose low donor chimerism is felt to be due to rapidly progressive
             hematological malignancies, unless they can be treated into a minimal disease state
             with additional treatment.

          2. Patients with active uncontrolled CNS involvement with malignancy.

          3. Fertile men or women unwilling to use contraceptive techniques during and for 12
             months following treatment.

               -  Patients with these end-organ toxicities may be presented to the RMBMTP Patient
                  Care Conference. If the majority opinion is that this treatment is the safest
                  option for a patient who has rejected their first transplant, they will be
                  allowed to undergo the treatment, after informed consent has been signed.

                    -  Patients with a positive PRA or anti-donor T or B cell (+) will be
                       considered for this treatment protocol only if no other option is
                       available. They should not be eligible for another research study. The
                       transplantation group must have a majority opinion that this is the best
                       available option for the patient in question. In patients with either
                       condition, the only acceptable stem cell source will be peripheral blood.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 2 years.

          -  History of diagnosis of childhood malignancy or HSCT and completion of therapy prior
             to entering the study. In order to be eligible for the study, patients must have been
             diagnosed with cancer prior to the age of 18.  Eligible patients must be free of
             their underlying malignancy for at least one year prior to entering the study, as
             confirmed by records from the referring oncologist.

          -  We will request permission to administer the Child Health Questionnaires (PF 50 and
             CF87) to all patients who are enrolled in this protocol. Patients who do not speak
             and read English will be excluded from the questionnaire. This instrument has been
             validated for use in children ages five and older. Children 10 years and older will
             complete the child version. The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) has been normed in a
             representative sample in the US, and is being used in large population studies in
             Australia, Ireland, and the UK. Additionally, it has been rigorously translated into
             a number of languages using international guidelines including American-Spanish,
             Canadian French, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Greek, Honduran- Spanish,
             Mexican-Spanish, Norwegian, Portuguese, and Swedish. For this study will purchase the
             CHQ in American- Spanish in order to include Spanish-speaking subjects in this part
             of the study. The costs to purchase the CHQ in numerous languages would be
             prohibitive for this pilot study. However, if a significant number of subjects in a
             specific language are recruited, we will consider the purchase of the CHQ for that
             group of subjects.

   Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or
             unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.  GEJ
             adenocarcinoma may be classified according to Siewert's classification type I, II, or
             III[43].

          -  Histological documentation of local recurrence or metastasis is strongly encouraged,
             unless the risk of such a procedure outweighs the potential benefit of confirming the
             metastatic disease.

          -  If no histologic confirmation, then the metastases or recurrence will require
             documentation by a 2nd radiographic procedure (eg. PET/CT scan or MRI in addition to
             the CT scan).  If the imaging procedure does not confirm recurrent or metastatic
             disease, biopsy confirmation will be required.

          -  Patients must have disease that can be evaluated radiographically.  This may be
             measurable disease or non-measurable disease.  Measurable disease is defined as that
             which can be measured in at least one dimension as &gt; 20 mm with conventional
             techniques, or &gt;10 mm by high resolution imaging. Disease that is identified on
             radiology studies, but does not meet the criteria for measurable disease, is
             considered non-measurable.

          -  Patients may have received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable
             disease.  Patients may have received prior adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or
             chemoradiation) if more than 6 months have elapsed between the end of adjuvant
             therapy and registration.  Patients may not have received prior docetaxel or
             cisplatin.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; than or = to 70% (ECOG performance status 0-1).

          -  Hepatic (minimal values):

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; or = to  1.5

             * * AST and ALT and Alkaline phosphatase must be within the eligible range. In
             determining eligibility, the more abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be
             used. Patients with alkaline phosphatase elevation secondary to the bony metastases
             rather than liver dysfunction may proceed with treatment on protocol after discussion
             with the principal investigator.

          -  Kidney function (minimal values):

             * Serum creatinine &lt; than or = to 1.5 mg/dl - if serum creatinine is 1.2-1.5 mg/dl,
             the creatinine clearance (either measured or calculated) must be 50 ml/min or greater

          -  The patient has a PT (INR) &lt; than or = to 1.5 and an PTT &lt; than or = to 3 seconds
             above the upper limits of normal if the patient is not on anticoagulation. If a
             patient is on full-dose anticoagulants, the following criteria should be met for
             enrollment:

               -  The patient must have an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose
                  of warfarin or on stable dose of LMW heparin

               -  The patient must not have active bleeding or pathological conditions that carry
                  high risk of bleeding (e.g. tumor involving major vessels, known varices)

          -  Women of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective

          -  Ability to understand informed consent and signing of written informed consent
             document prior to initiation of protocol therapy.

          -  Patients must have HER2-positive (FISH+ or IHC 3+) metastatic or unresectable gastric
             or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma to be eligible for trastuzumab. For
             the purposes of this protocol, FISH+ is defined as HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0. Biopsy
             samples with cohesive IHC3+ or FISH+ clones are considered HER2 positive irrespective
             of size, i.e.&lt;10%. FISH+ defined as &gt;2 HER2:CEP17.

          -  Patients who are receiving trastuzumab must have a left ventricular ejection fraction
             of ≥ 50%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received previous chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or
             unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are ineligible.

          -  Patients who have received previous pre- or post-operative chemotherapy or
             chemoradiation are ineligible if therapy was completed less than 6 months prior to
             study registration. Patients must have recovered from adverse events from any
             previous therapy.

          -  The patient is 18     74 years of age.

          -  The patient has a potentially suitable 8/8  donor if they are between the ages of
             69-74 years of age or a potentially suitable 8/8 or 7/8 unrelated donor(s) in the
             National Marrow Registry or Other Available Registry if they are between the ages of
             18-74.

          -  The patient currently does not meet the protocol   s eligibility/enrollment criteria
             for any reason.

          -  There is a high likelihood that the patient, in the opinion of the PI or LAI, will
             meet the protocol   s eligibility/enrollment criteria to proceed to transplant after
             standard therapy is completed.

          -  The patient or legal guardian is able to give informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA     RECIPIENT ON STANDARD CARE THERAPY:

          -  HIV infection.  There is theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression
             associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV infection.

          -  Pregnant or lactating.  Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective
             method of contraception. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant
             and the medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a

             not requiring treatment. Rationale: systemic inflammation may induce
             microalbuminuria.

          -  Diabetes by history

          -  IL-2, IL-7 or IFN-alpha therapy within past 3 months.  Rationale: IL-2 and IFN-alpha
             therapy induce renal dysfunction and IL-7 may be associated with systemic
             inflammation.

          -  Non compliance, alcohol use, and drug use are conditions that make study completion
             unlikely or difficult.

          -  Diabetes (fasting glucose greater than 125 mg/dL or 2 hour oral glucose tolerance
             value greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL or current diagnosis of diabetes).

          -  Serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL.

          -  Urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 0.5 and sustained on at least 2
             measurements.

             genetic mutation associated with the development of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
             (i.e. family history of CDH1 mutation).

        These individuals will sign the "Patient/Relative Consent". Following enrollment, we will
        assign individuals to the appropriate High Genetic Risk or Low Genetic Risk groups based
        on the age of diagnosis and their family history.

        Control Cohort

        Must meet all criteria below:

          1. Does not have gastric cancer.

          2. Not a blood relative of patient or relative participants.

          3. No family history of a mutation in the CDH1 gene.

        These individuals will sign the "Control consent". Note: A participant's genetic risk
        group is subject to change due to change in their diagnosis, family history, or genetic
        test results.

             diagnoses will be verified by obtaining pathologic documentation. The spectrum of
             familial lymphoproliferative syndromes (LPS) may include all types of lymphoma as
             well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is an additional reason to have a broad
             eligibility. Subset analysis will be performed on specific types of lymphoid
             neoplasms. DNA of patients with a family history of lymphoma who have consented to
             protocol 93-102 ("Ascertainment of Peripheral Blood or Saliva Samples for Genetic
             Epidemiology Studies of Familial Cancers") will also be eligible for inclusion in
             this study.

          -  Family members of probands including patients, sisters, brothers, halfbrothers and
             sisters, sons, daughters, grandparents, as well as aunts and uncles are also
             eligible. An effort will be made to ascertain all living affected and unaffected
             living relatives in the affected lineage. An emphasis will be on affected sibling
             pairs and both parents, if alive.

          -  Also eligible for inclusion are up to 2000 anonymized familial lymphoma/leukemia
             samples from Montefiore Medical Center, with information on age of onset, gender,
             lymphoma or leukemia type, familial relationship, and year of sample collection. No
             PHI will be used and therefore these samples will be fully and permanently anonymized
             to MSKCC.

          -  As this study involves research that presents no greater than minimal risk to
             children (see Sec. 46.404 of Federal Regulations part 46), minors are also eligible
             for participation. The assent of any minor should be obtained before the patient is
             enrolled into this study, as well as the consent of the legal guardian.

   Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary refractory AML (that is no prior remission). Patients who have
             greater than 10% AML blasts in the bone marrow or blood upon recovery from two cycles
             of standard cytarabine- and anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy are eligible.

             will be eligible.

          -  Patients with relapsed AML. Patients must have had a documented remission lasting &gt;
             30 days at some point during their prior therapy. Their current relapse must be
             untreated. Relapse is defined as the presence of greater than 10% AML blasts in the
             bone marrow or blood after having had a documented remission.

          -  Patients who have received a high-dose cytarabine containing regimen (&gt;2 g/m2/dose)
             within 3 months prior to registration on this protocol are not eligible.

             should not be performed in the absence of significant CNS symptoms or signs.

          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing. Treatment under this protocol would expose an unborn
             child to significant risks. Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to
             use an effective means of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Although NOT considered formal Exclusion Criteria, study physicians are strongly
        encouraged as part of this decision-making process to recognize that the following may
        increase the risks to a subject entering this protocol:

          -  Other serious illnesses which would limit survival to &lt;2 years, or a psychiatric
             condition which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.

          -  Performance Status &gt; 2.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or
             infection, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol
             treatment unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

          -  Patients with a "currently active" second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have a "currently active" malignancy if they
             have completed therapy and considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk
             of relapse within one year.

          -  Patients who have received any investigational agent within the prior 4 weeks.

   ELIGIBILITY:

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell cancer by biopsy or cytology.  Squamous cell
             carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, bronchioalveolar carcinoma, or
             non-small cell carcinoma (not otherwise specified) are allowed.

          -  Staging studies must identify patient as AJCC Stage I or II based on only 1 of
             following combinations of TNM staging:

               -  T1, N0, M0

               -  T2 (&lt;=7cm), N0, M0

               -  T3 (&lt;=7cm), N0, M0

          -  Primary tumor must be arising in one of the following central chest locations:

               -  Within or touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree (a volume 2cm in all
                  directions around the proximal bronchial tree [carina, R &amp; L main bronchi, R &amp; L
                  upper lobe bronchi, intermedius bronchus, R middle lobe bronchus, lingular
                  bronchus, R &amp; L lower lobe bronchi])

               -  Adjacent to (within 5 mm) or invading the mediastinal pleura

               -  Adjacent to (within 5 mm) or invading the parietal pericardium

          -  To differentiate T3 lesions involving the mediastinal pleura from T4 lesions
             involving major vessels or organs, a chest MRI will be obtained. If any uncertainty
             remains, the patient will have four-dimensional CT scans (4DCT) in an effort to
             determine the degree of tumor motion.  A freely mobile tumor during ventilation will
             be judged to be T3 disease.

          -  Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes &lt;=1cm and no abnormal hilar or
             mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0.  Patients with &gt;1cm hilar or
             mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but
             non-diagnostic uptake) may be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally
             identified areas are negative for cancer.

          -  Primary tumor must be technically resectable by an experienced thoracic cancer
             clinician, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a gross total resection with
             negative margins (potentially curative resection, PCR).  However, patients must have
             underlying physiological medical problems prohibiting PCR (i.e., problems with
             general anesthesia, the operation, the post-op recovery period, or removal of
             adjacent functioning lung) or refuse surgery.  Deeming a patient medically inoperable
             based on pulmonary function for surgical resection may include any of the following:
             baseline FEV1 &lt;40% predicted; post-operative predicted FEV1 &lt;30% predicted; severely
             reduced diffusion capacity; baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia; exercise oxygen
             consumption &lt;50% predicted; severe pulmonary hypertension; diabetes with severe end
             organ damage; severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease; or severe
             chronic heart disease.  Any one of these problems will qualify a patient for this
             trial.

          -  Age &gt;=18.

          -  Zubrod performance status 0-2.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception.

          -  No direct evidence of regional or distant metastases after appropriate staging
             studies.  No synchronous primary or prior malignancy in past 2 years except
             non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ cancer.

          -  No previous lung or mediastinal radiation therapy.

          -  No plans for concomitant antineoplastic therapy (including standard fractionated RT,
             chemo, biologic, vaccine therapy, or surgery) while on this protocol except at
             disease progression.

          -  No active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection.

          -  No pregnant or lactating women.

          -  PRESTUDY REQUIREMENTS:

               -  History and Physical Examination, Weight, Zubrod performance status (within 4
                  weeks pre-study entry)

               -  Pregnancy test, if applicable (serum or urine, within 72 hours prior to
                  treatment start.)

               -  CT (preferably with contrast unless medically contraindicated; both lungs,
                  mediastinum, liver, adrenals)

               -  PET (using FDG with visualization of primary tumor and draining lymph node
                  basins in hilar and mediastinal regions)

   Patient Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Timing of relevant evaluations: Taking in account the need for rapid intervention, if
             white blood count is less than 200 on day +20, bone marrow aspirate should be
             performed on day +21. Unless there is an increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             to &gt; 500 in the following 7 days, bone marrow aspirate should be repeated on day +28.
             If the white blood count is still less than 200 and bone marrow is acellular, bone
             marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donor should be reactivated and
             availability of cord blood (CB) units assessed. If the BM or PBSC donor is not

   Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior to receiving treatment, some patients may undergo diagnostic and/or other
             testing of their WT1 malignancies to determine if their disease is likely to respond
             to treatment with WT1 specific T cells. Alternatively, blood samples may be required
             for research tests to ascertain that the WT1-specific T-cells do not contain any
             cells that could react against the patient. These patients will sign a separate
             pre-treatment consent. If it is determined that a patient will qualify for and might
             benefit from infusions of WT1 CTLs, he/she will go on to sign the standard treatment
             consent for MSKCC IRB # 07-055 and be enrolled and treated on trial, if all other
             eligibility criteria are met.

          -  Patients eligible for this trial will include patients with a pathologically
             confirmed diagnosis of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who, following an
             allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, have relapsed with leukemia as demonstrated
             morphologically on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow aspirate, or have recurrent
             persistent minimal residual disease as demonstrated by at least 2 sequential testings
             separated by at least 1 week demonstrating molecular evidence of residual leukemia or
             MDS by FISH or cytogenetics. In addition, patients who are to receive an allogeneic
             hematopoietic cell transplant as treatment for a leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome
             that has an expected of risk of relapse post transplant of &gt;30% will be eligible to
             have donor-derived WT1 peptide specific T cells generated prior to or at the time of
             transplant for immediate use post transplant at such time that the patient is found
             to have minimal residual disease or relapse. This includes patients with AML or ALL
             that is either refractory to primary induction therapy or is at any stage later than
             first relapse for AML or ALL, CML in a secondary chronic phase, accelerated disease
             or after treatment for blast crisis or RAEB or RAEBT stages of MDS which have not
             responded to or recurred following induction therapy. Furthermore, the patient's
             leukemic or MDS blasts should be documented to express the WT1 protein detectable by
             immunohistopathologic analysis of diagnostic paraffin embedded marrow biopsies,
             obtained at diagnosis of relapse or be of a type known to commonly express WT1 at
             high frequency. Expression of WT1 will be assessed by a modification of the technique
             of Dupont and Soslow (36) and graded according to an adaptation of the German
             Immunoreactive Score (IRS) which is the product of subscores for intensity of
             immunoreactivity (0-3+) and distribution of immunoreactivity (0-4+). For this study,
             leukemic blasts with IRS scores of 4-12 will be considered positive.

          -  A pathologically confirmed diagnosis of leukemia or MDS.

          -  Patients who have already received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant and
             have either a documented relapse of leukemia or MDS or have recurrent persistent
             minimal residual disease as documented by at least 2 sequential testings, separated
             by 1 week, demonstrating molecular evidence of leukemia or MDS by FISH, cytogenetics
             or fluorescent immunocytometry.

          -  Patients who are to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant as treatment
             for a leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has an expected risk of relapse
             exceeding 30% will be eligible to have donor-derived WT1 peptide sensitized T cells
             generated prior to or at the time of transplant for immediate use post transplant at
             such time that the patient is found to have minimal residual disease or relapse. This
             includes patients with:

          -  ALL, AML or MDS refractory to primary induction therapy

          -  ALL or AML at any stage later than 1° relapse

          -  CML in 2° or greater chronic phase after chemotherapy

          -  CML in persistent accelerated phase or blast crisis

          -  High risk MDS (RAEB and RAEB+) which has failed to respond or has recurred following
             induction chemotherapy

          -  The patients' leukemia or MDS blasts must express the WT1 protein detectable by
             immunohistopathologic analysis, or; if an adequate sample is not available for
             testing, , must have a form of leukemia (ALL, AMLs other than M5) or MDS (2° MDS,
             RAEB, RAEBT) known to over express WT1 in a high proportion of cases (&gt;60%). For
             patients who develop a documented relapse of leukemia or MDS following transplant,
             marrow aspirates should be evaluated for the proportion of blasts expressing WT1 by
             immunohistology or FACS whenever possible.

          -  The patient's hematopoietic cell transplant donor must consent to a 2 volume
             leukapheresis or whole blood donations obtained at one phlebotomy which, will total
             approximately 250 ml from which the WT-1 specific T cells to be used for adoptive
             transfer will be generated

          -  KPS or Lansky score &gt; or equal to 40

          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function at the time of treatment with WT1
             specific T cells:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; or equal to  1000/mm3, with or without G-CSF
             support.

        This requirement may be waived if the patient has hematologic relapse of disease or if
        patient has not yet recovered counts from chemotherapy.

          -  Platelets &gt; or equal to  20,000/mm3. This requirement may be waived if patient has
             hematologic relapse of disease or if patient has not yet recovered counts from
             chemotherapy.

          -  Creatinine &lt; than or equal to 2.0mg/dL

          -  ALT, AST &lt;3.0 and total bilirubin all &lt; 2.5 x the institutional ULN

          -  There are no age restrictions to this protocol.

          -  Patients with relapse also detected in the CNS may be treated on this protocol.
             However, if intrathecal chemotherapy is being administered, T cells should not be
             administered until at least 24 hours thereafter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active (grade 2-4) acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD or
             an overt autoimmune disease (e.g. hemolytic anemia) requiring high doses of
             glucocorticosteroid (&gt;0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or its equivalent) as treatment.

          -  Patients with other conditions not related to leukemic relapse (e.g. veno-occlusive
             disease or uncontrolled bacterial, viral or invasive fungal infection) which are also
             life-threatening and which would preclude evaluation of the effects of a T cell
             infusion.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

        Donor Eligibility for Donation of Blood Lymphocytes for Generation of Donor-Derived
        WT-1-Specific T Cells.

        The eligibility criteria for the donor of blood to be used to generate WT1 peptide
        sensitized T cells are:

          -  The donor of WT-1 specific T. lymphocytes will be the same donor who provided the
             patient's hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). These normal donors will be
             evaluated for evidence of prior sensitization to EBV by EBV serology. If the donor is
             seropositive, and donor T cells are sensitized with the donor's WT-1 peptide- loaded
             EBV transformed B cells, EBV-specific T-cells will also be generated from
             seropositive donors generating WT-1 specific T-cells, and their growth and
             persistence post transfer will be compared to that of the WT 1 specific T-cells.

          -  Since the donor will have already undergone an extensive evaluation of his/her health
             to ascertain eligibility for donating the patient's HSCT, re-evaluation for this
             blood donation will be limited to a clinical history, physical examination and blood
             tests to insure against any new condition which, in the opinion of the donor's
             physician, preclude the donor from donating the blood required.

          -  New health conditions which would exclude a transplant donor from a second blood
             donation are limited, but include:

          -  New onset of an HIV infection

          -  Other uncontrolled infection which could be transmitted to the patient by blood cells
             and would place the patient at significant increased risk of severe morbidity or
             death.

          -  Significant anemia with Hgb &lt; than or equal to 10 gm/dl, persisting since the time of
             the original transplant donation.

          -  History of myocardial infarction or stroke since the time of HSCT donation which
             might increase the risk of blood donation. A perspective donor will be informed of
             the purposes of this study, and its requirements. If he/she consents, the donor will
             be requested to provide two blood samplings.

          -  An initial donation of 25ml blood anticoagulated with heparin or ACD. This blood is
             used to establish a B cell line transfused transformed with the B95.8 laboratory
             strains of EBV. This EBV+ B cell line/ (EBVBLCL) will be used as an
             antigen-presenting cell. When loaded with the pool of WT-1 pentadecapeptides, the
             EBVBLCL efficiently sensitize T cells from the same donors against WT-1 as well as
             EBV.

        Because the establishment and testing of an EBV transformed B cell line suitable for use
        as an antigen-presenting cell require 4-5 weeks of in vitro culture, it is important that
        this sample be obtained as early as possible for patients at risk for leukemic relapse,
        since disease relapse most frequently occurs 2-6 months post transplant. Accordingly, this
        blood sample should be obtained from the donor prior to donation of the hematopoietic
        progenitor cell transplant whenever possible.

          -  A donation of either a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis collected in
             standard ACD anticoagulant. If it is impossible to collect a leukapheresis from some
             of the donors, a unit of whole blood will be accepted by the AICTF (Adoptive Immune
             Cell Therapy Facility manufacturing the clinical grade cell products under GMP
             conditions in MSKCC) for the generation of limited number of T cells. This blood is
             required for isolation of the T cells to be sensitized with the pool of WT-1 15-mers
             loaded on autologous dendritic cells or autologous EBVBLCL, and propagated in vitro.
             In addition, it is required to provide autologous feeder cells essential to sustain
             T-cell growth without the risk of stimulating the growth of alloreactive T-cells
             capable of inducing GVHD.

          -  This donation of a leukapheresis or a unit of blood will be obtained from unrelated
             HSCT donors at least 2 weeks after their donation of an HSCT, but soon thereafter as
             possible.

        In addition to providing written consent to these donations of blood for the purpose of
        generating WT-1-specific T-cells for potential use in the treatment of recurrent leukemia
        or persistent residual disease developing in the patient for whom the donor has provided
        an HSCT, each donor will be informed of and asked to provide separate consent to each of
        the following potential applications of the blood cells donated:

          -  The use of a fraction of the cells isolated to generate immune T-cells specific for
             viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) ,that can cause
             lethal infections or lymphomas in transplant recipients. Such T-cells could then be
             used, under separate protocols, to treat EBV-associated diseases (IRB 95-024) and/or
             to treat CMV infections (IRB 05-065) in the patient receiving the donor's
             hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant.

        Consenting to this application will limit the number of blood donations that would be
        required of any donor, since the white cells donated in a leukapheresis should provide
        enough cells to grow immune T-cells against WT-1, EBV and CMV.

        The donation of immune T-cells specific for EBV or CMV generated from the donor that are
        not used for or required by the patient for whom they were originally intended to a bank
        of immune cells that will be started and maintained cryopreserved under GMP conditions in
        the Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility at MSKCC, for potential use in the treatment of
        other patients with EBV lymphomas or cytomegalovirus infections that express HLA alleles
        shared by the donor.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Adult patients who are members of families in which there are at least two
                  immediate relatives from consecutive generations that have been diagnosed with
                  gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors (affected family member) and either have a
                  carcinoid tumor or are at a 50% lifetime risk of developing a carcinoid tumor by
                  virtue of being a first degree relative of an affected family member.  This
                  includes family members of patients with carcinoid tumors even if the patients
                  with tumors are unwilling to participate so long as we have appropriate
                  documentation confirming the diagnosis of the carcinoid tumors in the affected
                  family members.  Adult patients who are unable to provide informed consent but
                  whose wishes suggest they are willing to donate samples for research purposes
                  will be considered for study enrollment.

               2. Unaffected spouses of patients with a carcinoid tumor and who have children.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Families with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I, MEN II or other familial tumor
             syndromes such as Von Hippel Lindau Syndrome and Neurofibomatosis for which there is
             a known genetic predisposition to non-carcinoid tumors as well as carcinoid tumors
             will be excluded from the study.

          2. Pregnancy, breastfeeding.

          3. Anticoagulation, seizures, severe systemic disease of any sort, advanced metastatic
             carcinoid may be relative exclusion criteria prohibiting a full evaluation as
             described above under protocol design.  However, these medical conditions should not
             absolutely exclude participation in the protocol.  Participation in each protocol
             delineated evaluation procedure will be judged on a case by case basis with patient
             safety as the paramount consideration.

   -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Greater than or equal to 6 months to 21 years of age

        Diagnosis: Patients with NF1 and an inoperable plexiform neurofibroma that has the
        potential to cause significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck
        lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, brachial or lumbar plexus
        lesions that could cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result
        in major deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or significant cosmetic problems, lesions of
        the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful lesions.
        Histologic confirmation of tumor is not required in the presence of consistent clinical
        and radiographic findings. However, if any clinical observation or scan suggests possible
        malignant transformation, the tumor should be biopsied prior to therapy. Patients without
        biopsy-proof of a plexiform neurofibroma must have at least one other diagnostic criteria
        for NF1 as defined by the NIH Consensus Conference.

          -  Six or more cafe-au-lait spots (greater than 0.5 cm in prepubertal subjects or
             greater than 1.5 cm in postpubertal subjects)

        Specific eligibility criteria stratum 2:

        Disease status:

          -  Radiographic disease progression as defined for stratum 3 is not required for trial
             entry.

          -  Patient has clinical symptoms from the plexiform neurofibroma.

        Specific eligibility criteria stratum 3:

        Disease status:

          -  Patients must have a radiographically progressive plexiform neurofibroma(s) with or
             without clinical symptoms. Progression at the time of study entry is defined as:

          -  Presence of new plexiform neurofibromas on MRI within the last 12 months OR

          -  A measurable increase of the plexiform neurofibroma (greater than or equal to 20
             percent increase in the volume, or a greater than or equal to 13 percent increase in
             the product of the two longest perpendicular diameters, or a greater than or equal to
             6 percent increase in the longest diameter) over the last two consecutive scans (MRI
             or CT), or over the time period of approximately one year prior to evaluation for
             this study.

        Surgery/Residual disease: Patients are only eligible if complete tumor resection is not
        feasible, or if a patient with a surgical option refuses surgery. Patients must have
        measurable residual tumor present. For the purpose of this study a measurable lesion will
        be defined as a lesion of at least 3 cm measured in one dimension. Evidence of recurrent
        or progressive disease is NOT necessary. Patients must be at least 21 days from surgery,
        if performed, prior to receiving their first dose of study drug.

        Prior therapy: Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with
        progressive plexiform neurofibromas, patients may be treated on this trial without having
        received prior therapy. If patients have received prior therapy, they must have recovered
        from all toxic effects prior to entering this study.

        Performance Status: Patients should have a life expectancy of at least 12 months and a
        Karnofsky or Lansky performance score of greater than or equal to 50. Patients who are
        wheelchair bound because of paralysis should be considered    ambulatory    when they are
        up in their wheel chair.

        Organ Function: Subjects must have adequate hepatic, renal and bone marrow function as
        defined by the following parameters:

          -  An absolute granulocyte count greater than 1500/microL, a hemoglobin greater than 10
             gm/dl, and a platelet count greater than 100,000/microL at study entry.

          -  Bilirubin less than 1.5 mg/dl and SGPT less than or equal to 2 times upper limit of
             normal.

          -  An age-adjusted normal serum creatinine (see below) OR a creatinine clearance greater
             than or equal to 70 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

          -  Age less than or equal to 5, Maximum Serum Creatinine - 0.8 (mg/dl)

          -  Age greater than 5 to less than or equal to 10, Maximum Serum Creatinine - 1.0
             (mg/dl)

          -  Age greater than 10 to less than or equal to 15, Maximum Serum Creatinine - 1.2
             (mg/dl)

          -  Age greater than 15, Maximum Serum Creatinine - 1.5 (mg/dl)

        Baseline Clinical and Radiographic Evaluations: MRI scan of the target plexiform
        neurofibroma(s), performed according to study requirements, including axial and coronal
        STIR images within 4 weeks of enrollment on study. Patients with orbital PNF   s must have
        a baseline ophthalmologic evaluation as per Appendix G performed prior to study enrollment
        by an ophthalmologist familiar with the protocol guidelines. Patients with pain associated
        with the target PNF must be able to fill out the Pain Medication Diary with at least one
        week of documentation prior to study enrollment.

        years old) must sign an IRB approved document of informed consent indicating their
        understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study BEFORE any
        protocol related studies are performed (this does not include routine laboratory tests or
        imaging studies required to establish eligibility). When appropriate, pediatric patients
        will be included in all discussion in order to obtain verbal assent.

        EXCLUSION CRITIERIA:

             selected to receive ONTAK alone (group 3)  because tumor is not available can enroll
             at ay time they fulfill the Eligibility Criteria.  Pre-vaccination the goal is to
             establish a Minimal Residual Disease state (MRD maximum tumor diameter of any
             residual disease ≤ 1cm).  This can be achieved with surgery and/or salvage
             chemotherapy.  Ontak administration and/or vaccine therapy will commence at least 4

             affect compliance

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study.  Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Ontak.  These potential risks
             may also apply to other agents used in this study

   Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Within 12 weeks prior to study entry, patients must have a confirmed cytologic or
             histological diagnosis of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma and/or poorly
             differentiated carcinoma of the nasal cavity and/or paranasal sinuses. If the biopsy
             was collected outside of MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), the MDACC Pathology
             Department must assess and confirm the SCC diagnosis.

          2. 2. Stage II-IV disease; T 2-4, N any, M0. Measurable disease is required with the
             following criteria: Measurable lesions can be accurately measured, with at least one
             diameter &gt;\= 1.0 cm by spiral CT scan or MRI. Lesions can be bidimensionally
             measurable or unidimensionally measurable. Every effort should be made to measure
             lesions in two dimensions. Measurable disease is present if the patient has one or
             more measurable lesions. Non-measurable lesions/disease are all other lesions,
             including small lesions (those with measurements &lt; 2.0 cm; or &lt; 1.0 cm with spiral
             CT).

          3. Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 70 or ECOG PS 0-1.

          4. Age &gt; 16 years.

          5. Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count (AGC) of &gt;/= 1500 cells/mm3 and platelet count of &gt;/= 100,000
             cells/mm3;

          6. Hepatic Parameters: Total Bilirubin &lt;/= ULN AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must
             be within the range allowing for eligibility. In determining eligibility the more
             abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used. **Refer to table in protocol
             pg. 10**

          7. Hemoglobin &gt;/= 10.0g/dL

          8. Per MDACC Creatinine clearance guidelines, patients must have a Creatinine clearance
             &gt; 50 ml/min determined by 24 hour collection or nomogram: CrCl male = (140 - age) x
             (wt in kg)/serum Cr x 72 CrCl female = 0.85 x (CrCl male)

          9. Patients should have no substantial concomitant medical illness, which in the opinion
             of the attending medical oncologist, would render the patient unsuitable for the
             study (i.e., preclude safe administration of the prescribed chemotherapy treatment).

         10. Women Of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test (i.e., minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG), within
             72 hours prior to the start of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in the study, she should inform her
             treating physician(s) immediately. **Refer to pg. 10 of the protocol for the formal
             definition of a WOCBP.**

         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written Informed Consent Document
             (ICD). In the event that non-English speaking participants are eligible for this
             study, a short form (if applicable) or an ICD in their language, will be utilized and
             completed in accordance with the MDACC Policy For Consenting Non-English Speaking
             Participants.

         12. Willingness to undergo MDACC Audiology and Ophthalmology Assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Histology other than locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma and/or poorly

          5. Prior chemotherapy (i.e., as administered strictly for cancer treatment) within the
             previous 3 years. Use of chemotherapy agents for non-cancer treatment purposes (i.e.,
             arthritis treatment, etc.) are excluded from this criterion.

          6. Prior radiotherapy to the paranasal sinus region or the upper neck (i.e., prior
             radiotherapy to another disease site is acceptable).

          7. Initial surgical resection of the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity region rendering
             the patient clinically and radiologically disease free.

          8. Simultaneous primary invasive cancers or patients currently receiving any other
             investigational agents at time of study enrollment. Patients may have received
             investigational agents in the past. No washout time period is required.

          9. Patients with a past history of malignancy (excluding non melanoma skin cancers, and
             cancers treated &gt; 3 years prior for which patient remains continuously disease free).

         10. Men and Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling or unable to use an
             acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 3

             contraception. Note: WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception
             throughout the study and for up to 3 months after the study. Adequate methods of
             contraception will include (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive;
             tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or
             vasectomized partner).

         11. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         12. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other

   Inclusion criteria:  Pre-screening will be conducted to ensure that all subjects are in
        good neurologic health with no history of seizures or other neurological disorders, and
        that they have no ferromagnetic implants or clips in their body. Subjects will be
        right-handed exclusive-English speakers with normal hearing.

        Exclusion criteria:  If a subject is found to have profound or severe depression after the
        Neuropsychological and Cognitive Testing session they may be excluded from the imaging
        portion of the study. This is justified as the imaging session would not be valid as the
        biologic correlates of depression rather than chemobrain would be imaged. Subjects found
        to have profound or severe depression will be notified and appropriate referral made to
        get them the necessary medical care to treat their depression.

        Three cohorts of 8 women each under the age of 65 will be recruited for this exploratory
        pilot study. The "affected patient cohort" will be woman with complaints of cognitive or
        memory dysfunction who have received adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of breast
        cancer. These patients will be those being treated at Huntsman Cancer Hospital and be the
        patients of Dr Saundra Buys or Dr John Ward. The second "patient control cohort" will be
        age-matched woman with breast cancer who have undergone similar adjuvant chemotherapy for
        the same amount of time who have no complaints of memory dysfunction. Again these are
        primarily patients of Drs. Buys or Ward. The non-patient cohort will be age-matched woman
        who have not undergone any type of chemotherapy. These individuals will be recruited from
        friends of female family members of the two breast cancer cohorts. All individuals will be
        assessed for dementia and cognitive impairment using the same battery of dementia and
        cognitive/neuropsychological testing. All subjects will be age-matched as close as
        possible to eliminate age related cognitive effects. Subjects will be right-handed
        exclusive-English speakers with normal hearing. Pre-screening will be conducted to ensure
        that all subjects are in good neurologic health with no history of seizures or other
        neurological disorders, and that they have no ferromagnetic implants or clips in their
        body.

        Up to 40 subjects may be enrolled to ensure 24 evaluable subjects.
