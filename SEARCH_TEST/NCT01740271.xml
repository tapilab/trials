  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epirubicin is a common chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of breast cancer.
      However, chemotherapy dosing is calculated based on people's height and weight, which may
      not be the most accurate way. The purpose of this study is to see if epirubicin dosing based
      on people's genetic profiles is better than the usual methods.

          4. A Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (CHF) or angina, history of myocardial
             infarction within 2 months before study enrollment, or cardiac functional capacity
             Class III or IV as defined by the New York Heart Association Classification.
